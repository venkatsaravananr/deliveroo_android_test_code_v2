# Android Code Test

Hi! Thanks for applying at Deliveroo. :tada: 

Completing this exercise will help us to understand your Android skills before the onsite interview. It's designed to replicate everyday work, but set within an example movie app. You'll complete two tasks: review some code changes, then add a small feature to the app. Both tasks combined should take 3 hours and 30 minutes.

To get started, clone this repo and take a look around. The project should build successfully in Android Studio and the unit tests should be green.

## Code Review
*30 mins*

We've opened a pull request that adds a new __search__ feature. You may want to check out and run the branch: `feature_search`. Expect a range of issues from trivial code hygiene to serious bugs. Review the PR like it's real work from a colleague, focusing on the code changes. We evaluate this exercise based on the overall quality of the review, not the number of issues you spot.

> If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, that's okay: navigate to the PR, select "Files changed" to comment inline on the diff. Once you've completed your review, click the green "Review changes" button. Detailed guide [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-line-comments-to-a-pull-request).

## Feature Development
Please spend up to a maximum of *3 hours* on this task. If you cannot spare this much time, please do what you can and include the next steps you would take in the PR description.

Add the following feature, along with tests, to the app and open your own PR. (Create a new `feature_carousel` branch from master, rather than building on top of the search code!) Focus on adding the new feature over improving existing code.

Add to the movie details screen the carousel of similar movies, as shown in the [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/file/IP8r4qleju5FLYKLytpegc/Take-home-task?node-id=0%3A1).

You will need to refer to the API documentation for [Get Similar Movies](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-similar-movies).

Using third-party libraries is okay.

### Please fork this repo and create a PR back to this one for this task
(If you are unsure how to do this, please contact your recruiter and someone will be able to help)
